**Bonus Program** 
- Charlene's idea is to attract as many regularâ€˜s as possible to have a steady turnaround.
  She decides to offer a customer stamp card, where every 5th beverage is for free.
  If a customer orders a beverage and a snack, one of the extra's is free.

**Your task is to:**
- Write a simple program whose output is formatted like a receipt you would receive at a supermarket.
  The input to the program is a list of products the shopper wants to purchase (large coffee with extra milk, small coffee with special roast, bacon roll, orange juice)
